### What even is debouncing?

Debouncing is a method, in which function won't run until the time interval has passed, in search case debouncing, function won't run
untill we stop typing. Debouncing is a optimization technique to reduce amount of times that task will run.

### How does debounce function look like?

```js:javascript
function debounce(callback, delay = 1000) {
  let timeout;

  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => {
      callback(...args);
    }, delay);
  }
}

debounce(() => {
  console.log("Hello World!")
}, 3000)();

// after 3 seconds
// Hello World!
```

This is probably one of the most common way to implement debouncing, here we're creating debounce function, which takes callback function and delay as arguments,
and returns a function, which will be called after delay, and will call callback function with arguments, which were passed to debounce function, the timeout will also be cleared,
after callback function will be called.

Probably even more common way, is to just install debounce package instead of creating our own debounce function, which we'll do.

### Installation

```bash:bash
npm install lodash.debounce
# or
yarn add lodash.debounce
```

### Searching without debounce

```tsx:tsx
const [filteredCars, setFilteredCars] = useState(carMakes);
const [value, setValue] = useState("");

const handleChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
  setValue(e.target.value);

  setFilteredCars(
    carMakes.filter((car) =>
      car.toLowerCase().includes(e.target.value.toLowerCase())
    )
  );
};
```

```tsx:tsx
<input type="text" value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
```

### What's wrong with it?

Every time character is entered or deleted from the input `handleChange` function will run, and it will filter cars, which match the input value, while it's not a
problem with small arrays, but with large arrays, it could cause for example a lot of API calls, which could slow down the application, or in this case
for example with array of five thousands items it would try to filter every item in the array, at every character entered or deleted, which could be a problem, and not
only a problem, but could terribly slow down the application.

### Searching with debounce

We'll use `useMemo` hook, which will prevent re-rendering of the component, if the value of the input is the same as in the previous render, which will make our data
persist between re-renders.

```tsx:tsx
const debouncedSearch = useMemo(() => {
  return debouce(handleChange, 500);
}, []);
```

Now we'll make use of `useEffect` hook, to clean up any side effects that we might have created when our component gets unmounted.

```tsx:tsx
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    debouncedSearch.cancel();
  };
});
```

Final step is to make our input uncontrolled by removing value prop, and setting `onChange` prop to our newly created `debouncedSearch` function.

```tsx:tsx
<input type="text" onChange={debouncedSearch} />
```
