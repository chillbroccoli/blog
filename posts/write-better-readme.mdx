### What is README file?

README file is a file that contains information about your project. It is a good place to write a detailed description of your project and what it does.
It's the first file that should be read by a user when they visit your project. README file should be probably added to every single project.

Example of React's README file

README files helps users understand what your project is about and how to use it. When we're learning, or actually working as developer already, we are
often using some libraries or frameworks, without them we would not be able to understand how to use this specific library/framework, how to implement it,
what it does, this is of course about well written README files, because what good is a README file if you don't do not write it well, do not write it that
user reading this file will understand it, and will be just stuck 2 hours in trying to implement this library/framework in their project.

I would say that even if you're just learning, you should properly write your README file, even just to be getting better at it, I think it'll make you a better
developer, and probably even make you understand more deeply about your _"little"_, _"fun"_, _"learning"_ project, what it is about, and what should it do, and what it is
lacking. Even if the project is only for you, there's big chance that you will return to it, it feels good to comeback to your old project, understand it after reading
README file.

For people seeking job as a developer, it's another pro to be writting well your README files, it might be a huge plus for people checking your code/projects, interviewing you
to see that.

### What makes a good README?

Most necessary sections about your README

- Well structured titles and subtitles
- What's the project about, what problems it resolves, what good does it do
- Technologies
- How to get up and running

#### 1. Project Title

Self-explanatory, title of your project

#### 2. Project description

This is important part, this is where you're explainig what's the aim of the project, what is it about, what it is doing, what problems it might solve
for the user, if it's some kind of your personal project, then maybe you can explain what was your purposes when making this project, maybe what
languages/technologies you were aiming learn, or maybe some programming concepts to improve on.

#### 3. Table Of concepts

This one is not necessary, in not so long README files, it might be not usefull, but in longer ones, it might be good idea to add that, to help users
show every section of your README, and help with faster jumping between sections.

#### 4. How to get up and running

You should always give instructions how to install your project for example if it is a framework or library, or give instructions how to get it running
locally with instructions to for exampel install needed dependencies etc.

#### 5. Technologies

Write down a list of languages and technologies you used in your project

#### 6. Illustrations

Illustrations can give your project nice aesthetic.

#### 7. The Project Status

It's worth to mention on what stage your project is, if it's still in development, or if it's ready to be used.
