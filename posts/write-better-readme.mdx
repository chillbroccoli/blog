### What is README file?

README file is a file that contains information about your project. It is a good place to write a detailed description of your project and what it does.
It's the first file that should be read by a user when they visit your project. README file should be probably added to every single project.

Example of React's README file

README files helps users understand what your project is about and how to use it. When we're learning, or actually working as developer already, we are
often using some libraries or frameworks, without them we would not be able to understand how to use this specific library/framework, how to implement it,
what it does, this is of course about well written README files, because what good is a README file if you don't do not write it well, do not write it that
user reading this file will understand it, and will be just stuck 2 hours in trying to implement this library/framework in their project.

I would say that even if you're just learning, you should properly write your README file, even just to be getting better at it, I think it'll make you a better
developer, and probably even make you understand more deeply about your _"little"_, _"fun"_, _"learning"_ project, what it is about, and what should it do, and what it is
lacking. Even if the project is only for you, there's big chance that you will return to it, it feels good to comeback to your old project, understand it after reading
README file.

For people seeking job as a developer, it's another pro to be writting well your README files, it might be a huge plus for people checking your code/projects, interviewing you
to see that.

### What makes a good README?

- Well structured titles and subtitles
- What's the project about, what problems it resolves, what good does it do
- Technologies
- How to get up and running
